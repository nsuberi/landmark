        purposeText1: 'Community-held land and natural resources lie at the heart of social, political, and economic life in much of rural Africa, Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere. For communities and indigenous peoples, they represent fundamental assets—primary sources of livelihood, nutrition, income, wealth, and employment—and are a basis for security, status, social identity, and political relations. Land and resources also have historical, cultural, and spiritual significance for these men and women.',

        purposeText2: 'A transnational mobilization of indigenous peoples over the last 4 decades has resulted in the formal recognition of their rights in various legally-binding international instruments and non-binding agreements. Rights to land and natural resources are cornerstones of these instruments. Still, while many governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America acknowledge customary or community tenure rights to lands, few have established the strong legal protections needed to secure customary tenure over land. As a consequence, many indigenous peoples and communities throughout the world have lost access to critical natural resources, or lost their land entirely, threatening livelihoods and triggering resource-related conflicts.',

        purposeText3: 'New information and communication technologies are providing opportunities to address these challenges and help secure land rights. Indigenous peoples, communities and their partners around the world are using Global Positioning Systems (GPS), drones and other devices to map their land with great precision. Many have effectively used these maps to protect their land from external threats. And as more investors seek to acquire land, many communities want to share their maps with the public to let everyone know of their land claims, and proclaim, “We are here!”',

        purposeText4: 'About the Global Map of Indigenous and Community Lands',

        purposeText5: 'The Global Map of Indigenous and Community Lands (Global Map) is the world’s first online, interactive platform to provide maps and other critical information on indigenous and community (collectively-held and managed) lands. The Global Map is designed to help communities protect their lands. It puts the issue of indigenous and community land rights on the global agenda in a visible way, letting the world know of land claims and allowing indigenous peoples and communities to be proactive in asserting their rights rather than reactive to threats. Today, they all too often learn of threats too late such as when a government official arrives and declares the land now belongs to the state or an investor arrives to begin operations. The  Global Map helps build a global picture of indigenous and community lands and populations, supporting their engagement with one another and increasing their visibility to governments, corporations, and other actors.',

        purposeText6: 'The Global Map is targeted for use by governments, companies, development assistance agencies, civil society organizations as well as indigenous peoples, communities and their representatives. It supports open and accountable governments, and promotes responsible private sector investments. Governments with weak land administration systems can now see which lands are held and claimed by indigenous peoples and communities, helping guide land use management in ways that respect human rights and boost local livelihoods, challenging global paradigms, such as wildlife conservation and large-scale land acquisition. Public officials can also compare the situations and conditions in their countries with those in other nations, prompting actions to recognize indigenous and community land rights.',

        purposeText7: 'The Global Map can promote changes in corporate behaviour and action in identifying lands for investments, reducing company risks and costs by respecting local land and natural resource rights. Companies making investments can use the Global Map to avoid acquiring contested land and learn who they need to negotiate with over rights to indigenous and community land. The Global Map can also inform development assistance agency decisions and help them better target their resources and technical assistance.',

        mapDevelopment1: 'In March 2013, the Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI), Oxfam, and the International Land Coalition (ILC) convened a small group of land rights experts at the Rockefeller Foundation’s Bellagio Center in Italy to develop a common framework to scale actions in support of community land rights. The framework included four components. The Instituto del Bien Común (IBC) in Peru and World Resources Institute (WRI) were asked to lead the “information and documentation” component.',

        mapDevelopment2: 'In September 2013, IBC and WRI, together with the Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (AMAN) from Indonesia, co-led the “Mapping & Documentation” sessions at the follow-up international conference—Scaling-Up Global Efforts to Securing Community Land and Resource Rights—convened in Interlaken, Switzerland, by RRI, ILC and Oxfam. The “Mapping & Documentation” sessions identified a number of scaling efforts, but discussions focused on the development of the Global Map.',

        mapDevelopment3: 'In February 2014, IBC, ILC and WRI convened a group of land rights organizations in Rome to discuss objectives and options for establishing the Global Map. In addition to the co-organizers, participating groups included: AMAN, Foundation for Ecological Security (FES) in India, Philippine Association for Intercultural Development (PAFID), Forest Peoples Programme (FPP), RFUK, RRI, and Liz Alden Wily, independent land tenure specialist. The group agreed to establish themselves into a Steering Group to guide the development of the Global Map.',

        mapDevelopment4: "In June 2014, WRI and IBC met in Lima, Peru, to further develop the Global Map with particular attention to developing an initial typology to present the community land maps, various technical protocols and the initial data layers. WRI and IBC were joined by Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) in Brazil and the World Atlas of Indigenous Peoples' Territories (WAIPT) in France. ISA represented Red Amazónica de Información Socioambiental Georreferenciada (RAISG), a coalition of civil society organizations from Amazon Basin countries. The WAIPT project is a collaborative effort between the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Survival International (France), and Sorbonne Nouvelle University with the support of the Ile-de-France region. WAIPT has since formally joined the Steering Group.",

        mapDevelopment5: 'Shortly after the Lima meeting and with the assistance of Blue Raster, a design firms, WRI, IBC and the Steering Group began designing and building the Global Map—collecting and preparing the information for the various data layers, developing wireframes and building out the website. In 2015, with the approval of the Steering Group, the Beta 2 platform of the Global Map was made available to the public for review and input.',
