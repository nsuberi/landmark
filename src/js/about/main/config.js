        // purposeText2: 'A transnational mobilization of indigenous peoples over the last 4 decades has resulted in the formal recognition of their rights in various legally-binding international instruments and non-binding agreements. Rights to land and natural resources are cornerstones of these instruments. Still, while many governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America acknowledge customary or community tenure rights to lands, few have established the strong legal protections needed to secure customary tenure over land. As a consequence, many indigenous peoples and communities throughout the world have lost access to critical natural resources, or lost their land entirely, threatening livelihoods and triggering resource-related conflicts.',

The framework included four components. The Instituto del Bien Común (IBC) in Peru and World Resources Institute (WRI) were asked to lead the “information and documentation” component.',

The “Mapping & Documentation” sessions identified a number of scaling efforts, but discussions focused on the development of the Global Map.',

WRI and IBC were joined by Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) in Brazil and the World Atlas of Indigenous Peoples' Territories (WAIPT) in France. ISA represented Red Amazónica de Información Socioambiental Georreferenciada (RAISG), a coalition of civil society organizations from Amazon Basin countries. The WAIPT project is a collaborative effort between the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Survival International (France), and Sorbonne Nouvelle University with the support of the Ile-de-France region. WAIPT has since formally joined the Steering Group.",

In 2015, with the approval of the Steering Group, the Beta 2 platform of the Global Map was made available to the public for review and input.',
